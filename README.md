# IPLogin
### Basic PaperMC plugin for IP login
When you first login, the plugin stores your username and IP, and the next time someone joins with your username, if the IP is correct, nothing happens, but if the IP is incorrect, it gets banned.

Alts are also banned, if a new player has the IP of an already existing player, the IP gets banned.
